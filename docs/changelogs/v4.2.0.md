## Input file changes


## Known issues
There are several issues that have not been addressed in this release due to time constraints, but will be addressed in future releases.  These include:

- No visualization of rectangular members from _HydroDyn_ or _SubDyn_ through the VTK output options
- Missing and broken features from several c-binding library interfaces:
   - the _AeroDyn\_Inflow\_c-binding_ library interface does not allow for coupling to the tower.  This will require an interface update.
   - the _HydroDyn\_c-binding_ library interface does not currently support vizualization.  This will require an interface update.
   - the `InitNodePositions` input to _HydroDyn\_c-binding_ library interface does not currently work with any non-zero `x` or `y` coordinates (non-zero `z` is ok)
   - the _MoorDyn\_c-binding_ library interface does not currently support vizualization.  This will require an interface update.
- Documentation on the new _pyOpenFAST_ module is incomplete.  Partial documentation exists on how to use it in regression testing, but no documentation or examples exist on using it to call c-bindings modules from Python.
- Documentation is incomplete for _HydroDyn_, _SubDyn_, and a few other modules.



# Precompiled Windows Binaries
The binary files in this release were built with the Visual Studio solution files distributed with OpenFAST (not using cmake), using

- Intel Fortran Essentials 2025.3.0.333
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 Version 17.14.23.
- MATLAB 2025.2.999 (R2025b)
- Executables with `_OpenMP` or `_OMP` in the name are built with OpenMP libraries and linked with dynamic libraries.
   - You will need [this Intel Fortran redistributable package](https://registrationcenter-download.intel.com/akdlm/IRC_NAS/0dc56e76-d2c0-4bb8-9c83-c2ee3952b855/w_ifx_runtime_p_2025.2.1.1001.exe) installed to use these executables if you do not already have Intel Fortran OneAPI 2024 installed. See the installation instructions [here](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/redistributable-libraries-for-intel-c-and-fortran-2022-compilers-for-windows.html).

**The other OpenFAST executables DO NOT require these redistributable libraries to be installed. Instead, they were built with static libraries.**
